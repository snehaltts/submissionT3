   **Number Conversion Calculator**

**What**-Converting a number written in binary to a number system with another base like decimal and also converting a decimal number to a binary and then again convert into binary to octal and octal to binary.

**Where**-Then binary numbers are commonly used in digital and computer circuits and are represented by either a logic “0” or a logic “1”. Binary numbering systems are best suited to the digital signal coding of binary, as it uses only two digits, one and zero, to form different figures.

**Why**-We use converter because Computers use Binary and they can only read and store an on or off charge. To keep calculations simple and convert into binary online, computer use the Binary system.

**When**- The digits: 0 and 1, are used by binary code to represent computer text or instructions and a bit string is assigned to each symbol or instruction.

**How**-

1.Decimal to Binary: The most popular way to convert a decimal number into the binary is the double dabble method. In this method, the given decimal number is progressively divided by 2 and writing the remainder after each division. When all the remainder is read in reverse order, the binary number is obtained.

2.Binary to Decimal:To convert the binary number to a decimal number, we use the multiplication method. In this conversion process, if a number with base n has to be converted into a number with base 10, then each digit of the given number is multiplied from the Most Significant Bit (MSB) to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) with reducing the power of the base.

3.Binary to Octal: In binary to octal conversion, we learn to convert base 2 number system into base 8 number system. We cannot directly convert binary to octal, so we first convert binary to decimal, then the decimal number to the equivalent octal number system. Binary numbers are commonly used in computers, in the form of bits and bytes, since the computer understand the language of 0 and 1 only. At the same time, octal numbers are used in electronics.

4.Octal to Binary: In order to convert octal to binary number, we have to follow a few steps. Octal numbers have base 8 and binary numbers have base 10. We cannot directly convert an octal number into a binary number, but by converting the octal into a decimal number, which has base 10. Then we will proceed to convert the decimal number into its equivalent binary number.

5.Hexadecimal to Decimal:  Hexadecimal number is one of the number systems which has value is 16 and it has only 16 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and A, B, C, D, E, F. Where A, B, C, D, E and F are single bit representations of decimal value 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively. Whereas Decimal system is most familiar number system to the general public. It is base 10 which has only 10 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and in conversion from Hexadecimal to Decimal number system
There are various indirect or direct methods to convert a hexadecimal number into decimal number. In an indirect method, you need to convert a hexadecimal number into binary or octal number, then you can convert it into decimal number.

**History:**

The modern binary number system, the basis for binary code, was invented by Gottfried Leibniz in 1689 and appears in his article *Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire*. The full title is translated into English as the "Explanation of the binary arithmetic", which uses only the characters 1 and 0, with some remarks on its usefulness.

**Uses:**

It could be used in a primitive calculating machine, most modern computers use binary encoding for instructions and data. Telephone calls are carried digitally on long-distance and mobile phone networks using pulse code modulation on voice over IP network.

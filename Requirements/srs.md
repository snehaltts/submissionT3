**Number Conversion Calculator**

**What**-Converting a number written in binary to a number system with another base like decimal and also converting a decimal number to a binary and then again convert into binary to octal and octal to binary.

**Where**-Then binary numbers are commonly used in digital and computer circuits and are represented by either a logic “0” or a logic “1”. Binary numbering systems are best suited to the digital signal coding of binary, as it uses only two digits, one and zero, to form different figures.

**Why**-We use converter because Computers use Binary and they can only read and store an on or off charge. To keep calculations simple and convert into binary online, computer use the Binary system.

**When**- The digits: 0 and 1, are used by binary code to represent computer text or instructions and a bit string is assigned to each symbol or instruction.

**How**-

1.Decimal to Binary: The most popular way to convert a decimal number into the binary is the double dabble method. In this method, the given decimal number is progressively divided by 2 and writing the remainder after each division. When all the remainder is read in reverse order, the binary number is obtained.

2.Binary to Decimal: To convert the binary number to a decimal number, we use the multiplication method. In this conversion process, if a number with base n has to be converted into a number with base 10, then each digit of the given number is multiplied from the Most Significant Bit (MSB) to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) with reducing the power of the base.

3.Binary to Octal: In binary to octal conversion, we learn to convert base 2 number system into base 8 number system. We cannot directly convert binary to octal, so we first convert binary to decimal, then the decimal number to the equivalent octal number system. Binary numbers are commonly used in computers, in the form of bits and bytes, since the computer understand the language of 0 and 1 only. At the same time, octal numbers are used in electronics.

4.Octal to Binary: In order to convert octal to binary number, we have to follow a few steps. Octal numbers have base 8 and binary numbers have base 10. We cannot directly convert an octal number into a binary number, but by converting the octal into a decimal number, which has base 10. Then we will proceed to convert the decimal number into its equivalent binary number.

5.Hexadecimal to Decimal: Hexadecimal number is one of the number systems which has value is 16 and it has only 16 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and A, B, C, D, E, F. Where A, B, C, D, E and F are single bit representations of decimal value 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively. Whereas Decimal system is most familiar number system to the general public. It is base 10 which has only 10 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and in conversion from Hexadecimal to Decimal number system There are various indirect or direct methods to convert a hexadecimal number into decimal number. In an indirect method, you need to convert a hexadecimal number into binary or octal number, then you can convert it into decimal number.

**History:**

The modern binary number system, the basis for binary code, was invented by Gottfried Leibniz in 1689 and appears in his article *Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire*. The full title is translated into English as the "Explanation of the binary arithmetic", which uses only the characters 1 and 0, with some remarks on its usefulness.

**Uses:**

It could be used in a primitive calculating machine, most modern computers use binary encoding for instructions and data. Telephone calls are carried digitally on long-distance and mobile phone networks using pulse code modulation on voice over IP network.

**Feasibility Study:**

1. **Technical Feasibility**

Number Conversion System is a tool used for converting a decimal number to its respective binary number and vice versa. The main technology and tools that are associated with Number Conversion System are

2.1 C Programming



2.2 Visual Code Studio

The above requirements are freely available and skills required for this are manageable. Time limit limitations of the product development and the ease of implementing using these technologies are synchronized. From the above statements it is clear that the project Number Conversion System is technically feasible.

2. **Operational Feasibility**

This project provides a very user friendly way to interact with the customer. Any user who does not have any understanding of programming technologies can also use this. We have allowed users to give text based inputs so that they can easily use this tool and this makes it more user friendly. Even normal people who are not familiar with technology can also use this application and perform the operations defined by us. It is clear from the above explanation that the project is operationally feasible. Technical Feasibility

3. **Resource Feasibility**

Resources that are required for Number Conversion System includes

3.1 Programming Devices (Laptops)

3.2 Code Editors	

3.3 Programming individuals

The above mentioned resources are easily available and hence it is clear that the project is resource feasible.

4. **Financial Feasibility**

Being a Number Conversion System tool it will not require any type of hosting. Since it is not operable via internet hence it doesn't require bandwidth and internet usage. Bug fixing and maintaining tasks will have an associated cost. At the initial stage the potential market place will be some secondary and high schools. Later on market place will be expanded to colleges and local public. Significantly it will reduce the efforts made by people to solve such kind of conversion problems as the conversion will be input based and fully automated. From these points it is clear that project Number Conversion System is financially feasible.

**SWOT Analysis**

**Strengths:**

- Easy to implement conversions.
- Binary coded decimals take as many bits as it requires.

**Weakness:**

- Float point conversions cannot be done.
- Calculations with these binary numbers are more complex.
- The major disadvantage of binary number is difficult to read and write for humans because of large number of binary for equivalent decimal number.

**Opportunities:**

- Binary coded decimal system is used all over the worlds computing systems.
- Binary coded decimal system provides a safety range for reliability.

**Threats:**

- Binary system may become obsolete in future.
- Binary and decimal systems are not used because of their complexities in their calculation.

**Scope:**

We communicate with each other in a particular language made of letters or words*.* We normally type letters or words through keyboard of the computer, but computer does not understand the words and letters. Rather, those words and letters are translated into numbers. This means that computers understand only numbers. We know the decimal (base 10) system, and are very comfortable with performing operations using this system, it is also important for us to understand that the decimal system is not the only system in the world. By studying other number systems such as binary (base 2), quaternary (base 4), octal (base 8), hexadecimal (base 16) and so forth, we will gain a better understanding of how number systems work in general. Number systems are the technique to represent numbers in the computer system architecture, every value that you are saving or getting into/from computer memory has a defined number system. As Computer architecture supports following number systems so we need to study them and also need to know the conversion technique between them.

- Binary number system
- Octal number system
- Decimal number system
- Hexadecimal (Hex) number system
